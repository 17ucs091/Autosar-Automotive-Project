## AA Getting Started üìñ

Android Automotive is the new embedded, fully functional operating system for vehicles. 
It contains a bunch of API packages allowing us to integrate Android OS functionalities with our car.

To build this application, we should aware of AOSP build [(Android Open Source Project)](https://source.android.com/)

Here I have used latest AOSP ROM to build android service jar.

If using jar is complicated please use this [Linux SDK](https://gitlab.com/filipmg/android-automotive-sdk) to build.
